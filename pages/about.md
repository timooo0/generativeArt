Hello!
Welcome to my website where I showcase the generative art projects I make. 

#### What is generative art
Generative art is all about making art from an algorithm. The idea is that from a simple set of rules complex behaviour emerges that looks great as well. Every piece is made by following the same rules but usually some element of randomness is introduced such that every single time you get a slightly different version.

#### Inspiration
Currently, I am at the start of the journey which means that most of the things I make are a copy of something I saw and I went, huh that looks cool I think I can make that. Slowly but surely I will work towards making more orignal works once I have a better idea of what is possible and what I want to make.  
Most of the work on here is inspired by posts on r/generative. If I can still find where the inspiration came from it is added to the posts. Also all of the source code is publicly available on my github.  

If you have any comments or ideas about any of the stuff I post please reach out to me!
